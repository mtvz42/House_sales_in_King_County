# House sales in King County, USA
This notebook was the final exam for the Coursera-IBM "Data Analysis with Python" course. Here I analysed the market price of houses and predicted prices using attributes or features. The dataset contains house sale prices for King County (USA), which includes Seattle. It includes houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
